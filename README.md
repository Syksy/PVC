Princess versus Creeps

This is a mobile-platform intended game project coded in C# for the Unity game engine. The graphics and animations have been made in SVG-format using Inkscape (v 0.91) by yours truly. The game design was initially made by my 3-yo daughter, who wanted me to make her a game "where she could play a princess and shoot baddies with a cannon". The next design spex was that "the princess is protecting the unicorns, and the creepies want to steal the unicorn horns". Hence, the project was born, though it's been on hibernation.

I intend to share the whole project open-source and distribute it for mobile (or desktop) devices for free and without ads. See license for further details.
